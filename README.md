# OTP-Verification-Using-Python
Do you know how you get a unique OTP every time you go through the payment process in an online transaction?  I will walk you through the task of OTP verification using Python.  you will be able to send a unique OTP to any email id for the OTP verification task.


Steps to Create an OTP Verification System using Python
OTP Verification is the process of verifying a user by sending a unique password so that the user can be verified before completing a registration or payment process. Most of the time, we get an OTP when we make an online payment, or when we forget our password, or when creating an account on any online platform. Thus, the sole purpose of an OTP is to verify the identity of a user by sending a unique password.



We can easily create an application for the task of OTP verification using Python by following the steps mentioned below:

1) First, create a 6-digit random number
2) Then store the number in a variable
3) Then we need to write a program to send emails
4) When sending email, we need to use OTP as a message
5) Finally, we need to request two user inputs; first for the user’s email and then for the OTP that the user has received.

OTP Verification using Python
I hope you now have understood what is an OTP and how we can create an application for the task of OTP verification. Now let’s follow the steps mentioned above by using Python to create an application for the task of OTP verification. I will start by importing the necessary Python library that we need for this task:

Now I will generate a random number and store it in a variable which I will be using while sending emails to the users:
